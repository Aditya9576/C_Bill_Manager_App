This is a very simple Bill manager program , made with C language.
I know this is a basic programming and a very simple task . But i very enjoyed making this , so i am sharing with you all.

Now ,Basically this program will help to create data of the name of the customers and the of total amount they purchased on the shop.
Program user can organize their data according to there need , ie : based on each day , each week , each month ; basically depends on the user requirement.

Here you can add data , delete data , 1 setp undo on the deleted data , display data, and can also print the whole data in a new file.

Lets see the program.

If you want to get a new clean plage to enter the data use this.
Then after creating a new page, go to today section.
A. go to add to add the data. first enter the name of the customer, then the total amount they spend.
Simply go on add this to enter customers name and amount.
To save this data type "*"  in the name section and press enter.

B. Now go to display section . It will display all the added data and the sum of the total amount at the bottom.
C. Now let we want to delete the "ram's" row from the data. So go to delete section and enter the index no of the ram amd press enter.
see in the display section "ram's" data has benn removed.
D.Now if we want to get back the "ram's" data back ,  go to the undo section to do so.

E: Finally if we want ot get these data in  a separate file ,the simply go to the print section and enter a name for your file and click enter. 
Now see in my case file is get stored in the win folder.

{You can get the code and the exe file from the github link ,  if you want to run the exe file directly on your computer then you have to move make sure that both the folders ,ust be on the desktop as mine , and the name of the folders must be same}
{But if you want to customize this according to your choice then, just exexute the program every time after making any changes in the file , code, folder names etc.}
